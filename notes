Option that reads all .fasta files in directory
Option that reads individual .fasta files

Parse each file line by line to get sequences
Capture length -- nucleotide and amino acid
	How to calculate length (tbd):
		- Individual seq length
		- Aligned seq length (but gaps are included)
		- length of total sig cooccurance regions

How are the output files for the pValues?
How are the output files for cooccurance data set?

Calculate %MinMax across co-occuring regions determined by significant pValues

Calculate %%Min across co-occuring regions with %MinMax values
	- Count # of %values below 0 divided by length (tbd)
	- Get %

How do I visualize this data set?
