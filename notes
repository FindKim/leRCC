Option that reads all .fasta files in directory
Option that reads individual .fasta files

Parse each file line by line to get sequences
Capture length -- nucelotide or amino acid?
	How to calculate length (tbd):
		- Individual seq length
		- Aligned seq length (but gaps are included)
		- Length of total sig coocurance regions

How are the output files for the pValues?
How are the output files for the cooccurence data set?

Calculate %MinMax across co-occuring regions determined by significant pValues

Calculate %%Min across co-occuring regions with %MinMax values
	- Count # of %values below 0 divided by length (tbd)
	- Get %

Look at runs to see if rare codon clusters (17 codon window) is conserved
	- Count how long runs are for sig orfs & non-sig
	- Create a histogram

Created ExtractSigOrf.cpp/.h
	- Takes in a sigOrf*.txt file
	- Checks if valid file
	- Parses file into vector of pairs that store organism name and seq #
	- Function to return seq # with organism name as argument

Created mmsort.cpp to create a copy of Aaron's .mm files but sorted numerical order
	- Useful for speed later down the pipeline
	- Can just iterate through the vector of sigOrfs once seq is found & calculated by just comparing string id's

Implemented ExtractMMSeq.cpp
	- Reads and parses minmax files into vector of id & seq pairs
